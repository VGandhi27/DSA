# Largest number possible
Given two numbers 'N' and 'S' , find the largest number that can be formed with 'N' digits and whose sum of digits should be equals to 'S'. Return -1 if it is not possible.

## Example 1:

Input: N = 2, S = 9  
Output: 90  
**Explanation**: It is the biggest number   
with the sum of digits equal to 9.  

## Example 2:

Input: N = 3, S = 20   
Output: 992   
**Explanation**: It is the biggest number   
with the sum of digits equal to 20.  

## Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findLargest() which takes N and S as input parameters and returns the most significant possible number. Return -1 if no such number is possible.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Exepcted Auxiliary Space: O(1)**

### Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104  
0 ≤ S ≤ 105
